# Provisioning AWS EKS Cluster using Terraform

Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) is a managed Kubernetes service provided by AWS. Through AWS EKS we can run Kubernetes without installing and operating a Kubernetes control plane or worker nodes. AWS EKS helps you provide highly available and secure clusters and automates key tasks such as patching, node provisioning, and updates.
